# Network Policy
A network policy is a specification of how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints.

**NetworkPolicy** resources use labels to select pods and define rules which specify what traffic is allowed to the selected pods.

By default, pods are non-isolated, they accept traffic from any source.
Pods become isolated by having a NetworkPolicy that selects them.
